ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

I'm Caroline, also known as Cami, a versatile multimedia creative who's now delving into the world of software development.
With a diverse background that includes stints as a music producer, an electrician, and a teacher, I've always been driven by a passion for creativity, problem-solving, and fostering connections through technology. This passion ultimately led me to make the exciting transition into software development.
I recently completed a rigorous full stack bootcamp at CodeOp - Tech School for Women+, where I gained a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. Now, armed with this knowledge and eager to continue learning and growing, I'm ready to dive headfirst into the world of tech.
As a full stack developer, I'm dedicated to crafting efficient and innovative tech solutions that prioritize user experience and satisfaction. Moreover, I'm deeply committed to advocating for diversity and inclusion within the tech industry, striving to create spaces where everyone feels valued and empowered.

Let's collaborate, innovate, and make a positive impact together! âœ¨

Tech Stack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Next.js, React, Context API, Express, Node.js, Vite, MySql, Figma, and Git.
